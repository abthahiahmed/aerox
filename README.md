### A C++ web framework with built-in view engine and file-system based routing.

This framework will simplify the implementation of web task for existing systems which is need to be host publicly. I'm currently working on it and has much more ideas to create a powerful web framework for C++ that can handle web task easily with easy syntax. Here is a quick documentation for quick intro about the framework. 

Currently this framework is build for linux. But I will also build for windows soon.

Current special Features:
- File-system based routing
- Built-in view engine that supports JSX like syntax on C++ files.
- API route can be created
- Has Request and Response object


A simple code snippet for routes (ExpressJS like syntax) : 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "./src/include/server.hpp"

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	
	Server server = Server(8080);
	
	server.setStaticDir("./public");
	
	server.get("/services", [](Request req, Response res){
		res.send("This is service page");
	});
	
	server.post("/submit", [](Request req, Response res){
		res.send("This is service page");
	});
	
	cout<<"C++ web server started..."<<endl;
	server.listen();
	
	return 0;
}
```

And this example is about a File-system based routing : 
```cpp
// pages/index.cpp
// This file will act as / route
@page Index(Request req){

    return <>
        <h1>Welcome to C++ Web Server</h1>
        <p>This is a alpha version of my C++ Web Server with a simple render Engine!</p>
    <>
}
```
```cpp
// pages/contact.cpp
// This file will act as /contact route
@page Contact(Request req){

    return <>
        <h1>Contact Us</h1>
        <p>Contact us for more information.</p>
    <>
}
```

I already mentioned that this is an initial push of the framework. More updates are coming. Star the repository for updates and support. You can also suggest feature idea for this on discussion.

Thank you so much...
